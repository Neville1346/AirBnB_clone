Description of the project

The first part of this project involves simulating an Airbnb application by creating a control system for the modules used on our web page. We achieve this by implementing a JSON-format database and leveraging object-oriented programming, Python data translation, and command interpretation. The result is a local database that can be easily modified using specific commands, providing a flexible and efficient way to manage data.
